Also implement Bezier curves for camera movement where user can specify control points.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**camera.cpp**\r\n* This take different point user clicks as input to the function and stores them as control points.\r\n* Then it draws the bezier curve corresponding to that using De Casteljau's Alorithm.\r\n* Also now camera can move over the curve while looking at the box on table.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**room.cpp**\r\n* This first initializes different display list for all the furniture and wall in the room.\r\n* This includes walls, table, chair, stool, cabinet and a lamp.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**light.cpp**\r\n* This contains the two lights placed above the door and inside the lamp.\r\n* This also has function of switching light on and off.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Controls**\r\n    \r\n    Arrow keys to move your camera + and - to zoom in and out of the view.  \r\n    \r\n    2 - Close Box  \t\t8 - Open Box  \r\n    d - Close Door  \t\tD - Open Door  \r\n    . - Wall light  \t\t, - Lamp Light\r\n  \r\n    5 - Switch Body    \r\n    1 - Rotate x -  \t\t3 - Rotate x +  \r\n    4 - Rotate y -  \t\t6 - Rotate y +  \r\n    7 - Rotate z -  \t\t9 - Rotate x +  \r\n  \r\n    n - Neck  \r\n    t - Torso    \r\n    h - Hip Left  \t\tH - Hip Right  \r\n    k - Knee Left  \t\tK - Knee Right  \r\n    a - Ankle Left  \t\tA - Ankle Right  \r\n    s - Shoulder L  \t\tS - Shoulder R  \r\n    e - Elbow Left  \t\tE - Elbow Right  \r\n    w - Wrist Left  \t\tW - Wrist Right  \r\n  \r\n    To make points for bezier curve click anywhere on screen and to move in or out use zoom in and zoom out.\r\n    Press space to generate curve and Enter to move camera on it.  \r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\n**Sample Images**\r\n\r\n\r\n![Sample7](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~manku/Images/the-music-box/sample7.png)  \r\n![Sample8](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~manku/Images/the-music-box/sample8.png)  \r\n![Sample9](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~manku/Images/the-music-box/sample9.png)  \r\n![Sample10](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~manku/Images/the-music-box/sample10.png)  \r\n![Sample11](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~manku/Images/the-music-box/sample11.png)  \r\n![Sample12](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~manku/Images/the-music-box/sample12.png)  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Citations**\r\n* Used SOIL Library for loading image as texture.\r\n\t- http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html\r\n\t- https://github.com/kbranigan/Simple-OpenGL-Image-Library\r\n* Used Nehe OpegGL tutorials to implemtent mirror in the room.\r\n\t- http://nehe.gamedev.net\r\n* Used images from different sources found by google image.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
